<!-- DESCRIPTION GOES HERE -->
In the 1996 redistricting court case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Vera">Bush v. Vera</a>, 
the United States Supreme Court ruled that districts 
"may pass strict scrutiny without having to defeat rival compact districts designed by plaintiffs' 
experts in endless <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-805.ZC1.html">
'beauty contests,'..." </a>
<br><br>
Following this sentiment, we have decided to engage the public in endless beauty contests 
of existing districts. This website was made in the two-day hackathon in the Boston 
<a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/gerrymandr/"> MGGG workshop </a> on gerrymandering. 

The districts shown in the main page are the 115th US congressional districts (retrieved August, 8, 2017), 
and should by no means be used as accurate depictions of current district shapes. This website is made 
purely for fun, and to see what shapes look good compared to others. Keep in mind that 
no district is drawn in context, and that "bad boundaries" may be affected by coastlines.
